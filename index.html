        <p>
          Our dreams are trying to tell us something - about ourselves, how we see the world, and our place in it.
        </p> 
        
        <p>
          In dream state, our minds become untethered, free to play out those scenarios we make up in our heads; to live in other realities, under different identities. A method of trying to peek into what (we) could have been and what (we) could be in another lifetime or parallel universe. Perhaps dreams are a coping mechanism for our lived realities.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Trying to remember a dream feels like holding water in cupped hands. They speak to us in metaphors, through amalgams of fragmented, complex, and often times nonsensical visual imagery. Of course, not all dreams are exciting and vivid, but even our most mundane dreams might reveal some of our deepest (darkest?) desires. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In this issue we attempt dream journaling as a way to gain more control over our subconsciousness. For several weeks, contributors will keep a dream journal and create a piece of work from their entries.
