        <p>
          PROPAGATOR is a collaborative zine, handmade and stitched together by a group of friends working in creative disciplines across art, design, and technology. Its inception came out of a need for time and space - for experimenting and engaging with different approaches to creating art, for expanding our horizons and creative practices, and most importantly, to develop a better understanding of ourselves and our place in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          In launching PROPAGATOR we present our first issue, <i>"DREAM MACHINE"</i>, a collection of fragments and artworks from several weeks of dream journaling.

      <h1>CALL FOR CONTRIBUTORS</h1>

        <p>
          Our dreams are trying to tell us something about ourselves.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In dream state, our minds become untethered, free to play out the scenarios we make up in our heads; to live in other realities, under different identities. It's the means by which our subconscious attempts to peek into what (we) could have been and what (we) could be - in the near future, or maybe in another lifetime or parallel universe. 
        </p>
        
        <p>  
          Our dreams are a more than a coping mechanism for our lived realities. While our dreams aren't always exciting and vivid, even our most mundane dreams might reveal some of our deepest (darkest?) desires. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          They often speak to us in metaphors, through amalgams of fragmented, complex, even nonsensical visual imagery. It's what makes remembering a dream a lot like holding water in cupped hands. What makes them even more complex is the fact that our dreams can transcend time and space. The events that unfold aren't necessarily happening sequentially - and maybe they suspend time altogether.
        </p> 
        
        <p>
          In this issue we attempt dream journaling as a way to gain more control over our subconsciousness. If it will help us develop a better understanding of ourselves, it can only help us in our creative practices. For several weeks, contributors will keep a dream journal and create a piece of work from their entries. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The output can be anything - a poem, an architectural drawing, a comic, anything - and does not need to be tied to what you do in your current practice/occupation (though we do encourage contributors to try new approaches to creating if they are up for it).
